/// Uploads recordings to jianshuo.dev/files via the R2-backed PUT API.
/// The Documents directory IS the pending queue: a `VoiceDrop-*.m4a` file that
/// still exists has not been uploaded. On success the file is deleted.
///
/// Resilience — why a finalized take never gets stuck on 正在上传 anymore:
/// - each PUT holds a short **background-task assertion**, so an upload kicked
///   off in the foreground (e.g. right after recording) can finish even if the
///   user immediately locks the screen or switches apps — iOS no longer kills
///   the request the instant we leave the foreground;
/// - transient failures (network blip, timeout, task-cancelled-on-suspend, 5xx)
///   are **retried with backoff** in-call; a take that still fails is left on
///   disk for the next drain — it is never lost;
/// - `drainPending` no longer aborts the queue on the first failure, so one
///   stubborn take can't wedge everything queued behind it;
/// - an `NWPathMonitor` re-drains the queue the moment connectivity returns.
