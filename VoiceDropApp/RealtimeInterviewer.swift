/// Orchestrates a recording session with an ON-DEMAND AI interviewer overlay.
///
/// ARCHITECTURE (2026-07-08, "采访 = 录音的可叠加旁路"): recording and the interview
/// are decoupled. `start()` starts ONLY the `EngineRecorder` (two-engine, no VPIO —
/// VPIO gave 0 mic buffers on this device) — that's the sacred main path, writing the
/// m4a from the tap unconditionally. The AI interview is a SIDE-PATH the user toggles
/// on/off mid-recording via the 采访 button: `toggleInterview()` connects/disconnects
/// the relay WS. The tap's PCM tee feeds the relay only while the interview is active;
/// the file write never depends on any of this.
///
/// Turn-taking is SERVER/PROMPT-driven: the worker configures `semantic_vad` +
/// `create_response:true` + `interrupt_response:false`, and the interviewer
/// instructions tell the model to stay silent and only interject when the speaker
/// is stuck. No app-side timer here.
///
/// HALF-DUPLEX (no AEC): the AI's loudspeaker leaks into the mic, so while the AI is
/// speaking we PAUSE the uplink (mute) and resume only after response.done AND the
/// playback has drained + a short echo tail — otherwise the model hears its own tail
/// and loops. AI audio in the recording is acceptable (user-confirmed).
///
/// Each toggle-on → toggle-off is an independent relay session; the worker settles
/// billing on WS close.
