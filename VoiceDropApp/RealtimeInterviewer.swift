/// Orchestrates a realtime AI-interviewer recording session: owns the
/// `EngineRecorder` (two-engine, no VPIO — VPIO gave 0 mic buffers on iOS 26 / this
/// device after exhaustive attempts) and the `RealtimeSession` (relay WS). Wires mic
/// PCM → relay and AI audio → speaker.
///
/// Turn-taking is SERVER/PROMPT-driven (2026-07-08): the worker configures
/// `semantic_vad` + `create_response:true` + `interrupt_response:false`, and the
/// interviewer instructions tell the model to stay silent and only interject a brief
/// question when the speaker is stuck. No app-side timer / rate-limit here.
///
/// HALF-DUPLEX (no AEC): the AI's loudspeaker leaks into the mic, so while the AI is
/// speaking we PAUSE the mic uplink (mute) and resume after a short echo tail — this
/// stops the model hearing its own voice (which would loop or cut its turn short).
/// Trade-off: you can't barge-in mid-AI-turn, but AI turns are short (<5 s). AI audio
/// in the recording is acceptable (user-confirmed).
///
/// Recording is sacred: `engine.start()` runs first; the relay is best-effort and any
/// failure just degrades (recording continues). Billing is server-side.
